  <title>Week 4 Handout- Vector Calculus- Part 3</title>

    <introduction>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>  <term> Vector calculus (Chap 9 in the textbook)</term> contains two parts:
          <ul>
            <li> <p> Calculus of scalar functions that have more than one variables </p>   </li>
            <li> <p> Calculus of vector functions   </p>        </li>
          </ul></p>  </li>
          <li><p> On Tuesday, we mainly discuss a few important theorems in vector calculus (Section 9.12, 9.14, 9.16). 
            On Thursday, No class in the morning and Exam 1 is between 3:45pm-5:45pm in STRGT 320.    </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> In Week 5, we will start Series Solution (Chap 5) and Fourier Series (Chap 12).
