  <title>Homework 2</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      <alert>Instructions:</alert> Submit your work by uploading a <alert>single PDF</alert> and 
      a <alert> single Mathematica notebook </alert> to D2L.  
      For the algebraic work, it can either be a scan of handwritten solutions or a PDF you created by 
      typing your solutions. Clearly label each problem and include your reference to which definition, remark, theorem and/or 
      which part of theorem in <alert>which week's handout</alert> is used for each step.   You can use Mathematica to 
      help you with algebraic work, however, you must show the steps and include explanation and reasoning. In Mathematica, 
      you must include text to clearly label your code and graphs.

    <ol> 
      <li> <p> <m>\textbf{r}(t)</m> is the position vector of a moving particle. Find the tangential and normal 
        components of the acceleration at any <m>t</m> and create a graph of the Curve <m>C</m> described 
        by <m>\textbf{r}(t)</m> consisted of the acceleration vector, and the tangential and normal components of acceleration
        at the given point.
      <ol>
        <li> <p> <m>\textbf{r}(t)=2\cos t\textbf{i}+2\sin t\textbf{j}+t^2\textbf{k},   t=\frac{\pi}{4} </m>    </p> </li>
        <li> <p> <m>\textbf{r}(t)=t^2\textbf{i}-t^3\textbf{j}+t^4\textbf{k}, t=\frac{4}{3}</m>  </p>  </li>
      </ol> </p>
    </li>
        <li>  <p> Two surfaces are said to be <term>orthogonal </term> at a point <m>P</m> of intersection if their normal lines
         at <m>P</m> are orthogonal, i.e., two surfaces given by <m> f(x,y,z)=0</m> and <m>g(x,y,z)=0</m> are orthogonal
        at <m>P</m> if and only if 
        <md> f_xg_x+f_yg_y+f_zg_z=0. </md>       
        
        Use the given result to show that the given surfaces are orthogonal at a point of intersection and create
        a graph to show the two surfaces, the intersection point, and the normal lines at the intersection point.
        <md> f(x,y,z)=x^2-y^2+z^2-4, g(x,y,z)=z-\frac{1}{xy^2} </md>         
        </p>    </li>
        <li> <p> Verify the given identify. Assume <m>f </m> as a scalar function, <m>\textbf{F}</m> as a vector function, 
          and continuity of all partial derivatives .  
          <ol>
            <li>  <p> <m>div (curl \textbf{ F})=0</m>   </p>    </li>
            <li> <p> <m>\nabla \cdot (f \textbf{F})=f\left(\nabla \cdot\textbf{F}\right)+\textbf{F}\cdot\nabla f</m>    </p> </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        </li>
        <li> <p> Any scalar function <m>f</m> for which <m>\nabla ^2 f=0</m> is said to be <term>harmonic.</term> 
          Determine whether each of the following scalar functions is harmonic.
        <ol>
          <li>  <p> <m> f(x,y,z)=\left(x^2+y^2+z^2\right)^{-1/2}</m>     </p>   </li>
          <li>  <p> <m>f(x,y)=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2y}{x^2+y^2-1}\right), x^2+y^2\neq 1</m></p>  </li>
        </ol>   
       </p></li>
