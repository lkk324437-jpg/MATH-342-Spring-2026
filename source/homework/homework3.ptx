  <introduction>
    <p>
      <alert>Instructions:</alert> Submit your work by uploading a <alert>single PDF</alert> and 
      a <alert> single Mathematica notebook </alert> to D2L.  
      For the algebraic work, it can either be a scan of handwritten solutions or a PDF you created by 
      typing your solutions. Clearly label each problem and include your reference to which definition, remark, theorem and/or 
      which part of theorem in <alert>which week's handout</alert> is used for each step.   You can use Mathematica to 
      help you with algebraic work, however, you must show the steps and include explanation and reasoning. In Mathematica, 
      you must include text to clearly label your code and graphs.

  <p>Find the radius of convergence and the interval of convergence for the given power series. 
    Plot the graphs of the truncated series of the first 2 terms, first 4 terms, first 6 terms, 
    first 10 terms, and first 20 terms on the same graph over the interval of convergence 
    with the legend. Describe your observations of the graphs as the number of terms in the 
    truncated Taylor series increases.
