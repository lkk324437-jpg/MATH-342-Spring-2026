    <title>Attendance</title>

    <p> Attendance and class participation is probably the single most important 
      factor for your success in this course. The policy for this course 
      is that students taking MATH 342 take responsibility for their own learning 
      and regularly attend class. There will be occasional in-class activities 
      completed and submitted in class. These activities are a graded part of the class, and you must be present to earn the points.

    <title>Late work</title>
    <p> For Homework, the late submission is allowed with 25% penalty per day. 
      For In-class Activities and Quizzes, the make-up is allowed for individual work 
      but it must be done before the next class period. No make-up is allowed for group work.  
      For exams, you must contact the instructor (via: email: yjkuo@iup.edu) 
      within 24 hours of missing an exam and be prepared to provide documentation. 
      Makeups are given at the discretion of the instructor and only in the case

    <title>Academic Integrity</title>

    <p>All students are required to abide by the University Policy on Academic 
      Integrity. YOU MUST DO ALL YOUR OWN WORK. See:  <url href="http://www.iup.edu/registrar/catalog"/> 
      and the section on Academic Policies and Academic Integrity: Indiana University of 
      Pennsylvania is committed to the fundamental values of academic integrity. 
      Academic integrity means honesty and responsibility in scholarly endeavors and 
      behaviors; it means that all academic work should be the result of an individual's
      own effort. Academic assignments help students learn and allow them to exhibit this
      earning. Grades are an assessment of the extent to which learning has 
      been demonstrated in assignments. Therefore, academic work and grades should be
      the result of a student’s own understanding and effort. All members of the IUP
      community-including students, faculty, and staff-are responsible for maintaining
      academic integrity, which includes knowing what IUP's academic integrity policies 
      are and being able to identify academic misconduct. 
      Academic misconduct includes any action which improperly impacts the assessment or representation 
      of a student's academic achievement. Academic misconduct may result in
      disciplinary action, including expulsion from the University. Students who do not do their own work 
      can be subject to penalty, including but not limited to zero grades on affected assignments and/or 
      referral to the University for academic integrity violations.

    <title>Title IX</title>

    <p>Indiana University of Pennsylvania and its faculty are committed to assuring 
      a safe and productive educational environment for all students.  In order to 
      meet this commitment and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 
      1972 and guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, the University requires faculty
      members to report incidents of sexual violence shared by students to the 
      University's Title IX Coordinator.  The only exceptions to the faculty member's 
      reporting obligation are when incidents of sexual violence are communicated by a 
      student during a classroom discussion, in a writing assignment for a class, or as 
      part of a University-approved research project. Faculty members are obligated to 
      report sexual violence or any other abuse of a student who was, or is, a child 
      (a person under 18 years of age) when the abuse allegedly occurred to the Department
       of Human Services (1-800-932-0313) and University Police (724-357-2141). 
       Information regarding the reporting of sexual violence and the resources that 
       are available to victims of sexual violence is set forth 
       at: <url href="http://www.iup.edu/socialequity/policies/title-ix/"/>
